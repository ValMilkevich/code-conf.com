## Your go-to page for anything CoDe
CoDe is how we abbreviate Continuos Delivery and www.code-conf.com is your go-to page for all kind of Continuous Delivery and DevOps related events; conferences, meetups, training, hackatons, academies.

We're organizing all kinds of events throughout all of Scandinavia.

## Why?

Continuous Delivery and DevOps are probably the biggest and most important paradigm shift in software development: Building quality in to the software as part of the development process, verifying and deploying it automatically and effortlessly as often as you wish while running on a programmable infrastructure, developed by the same people who developed the software. That is truly amazing!

_Everyone_ in our industry should know about this phenomena. That's why!
