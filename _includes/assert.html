if `is_true` is false â€” raises an error. If true, does nothing.
`error` parameter is not used by now, but good to output it in the future.

tried 
```
{% Error %}
```
as alternative, but it rise the error even if this code is unreached.

{% unless include.is_true %}
  {% include __error__ %}
{% endunless %}
