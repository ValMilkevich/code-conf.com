bio:  >
  Libo is an engineering manager at Zendesk. Three years ago, he was part of the first team to ship Zendesk Help Center, a customisable self-service portal, knowledge base, and online community - all in one. Since then he has been happily delivering innovation, maybe incrementally, maybe every day, maybe many times a day. Libo has an MSc in Industrial Design from Politecnico di Milano and has loved finding simple solutions to complex problems ever since.
