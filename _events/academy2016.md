So you’re a student in the field of Computer Science — cool! But still, you get that sinking feeling that you’re missing out on important best practices of the modern era of Continuous Delivery and DevOps?

## It’s free.<br> Honestly
Students are offered a free seat at the code academy! The only catch is that each day there will be a pitch from one of the sponsors about their company. But then again, they’re only here to recruit, so it makes sense right? But seriously, the lunch will be free.

## But why?
Here’s the thing — demand for Continuous Delivery and DevOps skills is far outstripping what is available the in the job market. We at Praqma are feeling this most acutely. So we thought: “Why do we only train our new recruits? Why not train everyone looking for work! So that not only Praqma employees get these skills but all people entering the industry?”

## Supporters
Each location will have five companies supporting the academy, Companies are looking to recruit in this field — you’ll be given a pitch by each one of them. Each Academy season has a set of technology sponsors as well. They are just happy to support the Continuous Delivery and DevOps revolution — and throw you swags.
